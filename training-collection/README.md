You need to configure [enterprise-integration-module](../../../enterprise-integration-module) in order to see these widgets in action.

### Installation & Configuration

The following steps are needed to add the enterprise integration widgets to your training environments.

- Copy training-collection inside the `statics/collection` folder of your Launchpad 0.13.x project.

- Open `statics/collection/bower.json` and add the following lines within `dependencies`:

  ```
  "2048-widget-register": "./training-collection/2048-widget-register",
  "2048-widget-players": "./training-collection/2048-widget-players",
  "2048-widget-login": "./training-collection/2048-widget-login",
  "2048-widget-highscores": "./training-collection/2048-widget-highscores",
  "2048-widget-game": "./training-collection/2048-widget-game"
  ```
  e.g.
  ```
  "dependencies":{
    "2048-widget-register": "./training-collection/2048-widget-register",
  "2048-widget-players": "./training-collection/2048-widget-players",
  "2048-widget-login": "./training-collection/2048-widget-login",
  "2048-widget-highscores": "./training-collection/2048-widget-highscores",
  "2048-widget-game": "./training-collection/2048-widget-game"
  }
  ```
